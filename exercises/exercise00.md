# Azure Synapse Analytics and AI hands-on lab step-by-step

**[Home](https://github.com/tayganr/MCW-Azure-Synapse-Analytics-and-AI#prerequisites)** - [Next Exercise >](../exercises/exercise01.md)

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on-lab, you will build an end-to-end data analytics with machine learning solution using Azure Synapse Analytics. The information will be presented in the context of a retail scenario. We will be heavily leveraging Azure Synapse Studio, a tool that conveniently unifies the most common data operations from ingestion, transformation, querying, and visualization.

## Overview

In this lab various features of Azure Synapse Analytics will be explored. Azure Synapse Analytics Studio is a single tool that every team member can use collaboratively. Synapse Studio will be the only tool used throughout this lab through data ingestion, cleaning, and transforming raw files to using Notebooks to train, register, and consume a Machine learning model. The lab will also provide hands-on-experience monitoring and prioritizing data related workloads.

## Solution architecture

![Architecture diagram explained in the next paragraph.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/MCW-Azure-Synapse-Analytics-and-AI/master/Hands-on%20lab/media/archdiagram.png "Architecture Diagram")

This lab explores the cold data scenario of ingesting various types of raw data files. These files can exist anywhere. The file types used in this lab are CSV, parquet, and JSON. This data will be ingested into Synapse Analytics via Pipelines. From there, the data can be transformed and enriched using various tools such as data flows, Synapse Spark, and Synapse SQL (both provisioned and serverless). Once processed, data can be queried using Synapse SQL tooling. Azure Synapse Studio also provides the ability to author notebooks to further process data, create datasets, train, and create machine learning models. These models can then be stored in a storage account or even in a SQL table. These models can then be consumed via various methods, including T-SQL. The foundational component supporting all aspects of Azure Synapse Analytics is the ADLS Gen 2 Data Lake.

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription
2. Azure Synapse Workspace / Studio
3. [Python v.3.7 or newer](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
4. [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#do-i-need-to-install-pip)
5. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
6. [Python Extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
7. [Azure Function Core Tools v.3](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=windows%2Ccsharp%2Cbash#v2)
8. [Azure Functions Extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions)
9. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
10. [Ensure the Microsoft.Sql resource provider is registered in your Azure Subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types). 

## Before the hands-on lab

Refer to the Before the hands-on lab setup guide manual before continuing to the lab exercises.

## Resource naming throughout this lab

For the remainder of this lab, the following terms will be used for various ASA (Azure Synapse Analytics) related resources (make sure you replace them with actual names and values from your environment):

| Azure Synapse Analytics Resource | To be referred to        |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Azure Subscription               | `WorkspaceSubscription`  |
| Azure Region                     | `WorkspaceRegion`        |
| Workspace resource group         | `WorkspaceResourceGroup` |
| Workspace / workspace name       | `asaworkspace{suffix}`   |
| Primary Storage Account          | `asadatalake{suffix}`    |
| Default file system container    | `DefaultFileSystem`      |
| SQL Pool                         | `SqlPool01`              |
| SQL Serverless Endpoint          | `SqlServerless01`        |
| Azure Key Vault                  | `asakeyvault{suffix}`    |

## After the hands-on lab

**Duration**: 5 minutes

### Task 1: Delete the resource group

1. In the Azure Portal, open the resource group for this lab. Select **Delete** from the top toolbar menu.

2. In the Azure Portal, open the resource group with the same name as your Function App. Select **Delete** from the top toolbar menu.

3. Open the Cloud Shell and issue the following command to remove the lab files:

   ```PowerShell
   Remove-Item -Path .\Synapse-MCW -recurse -force  
   ```

You should follow all steps provided *after* attending the Hands-on lab.
